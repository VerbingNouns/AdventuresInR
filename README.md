# Welcome to the Adventures In R Workshop!

*This repository will serve as the base for designing and sharing materials for the 2021 Workshop in R.*

This workshop has been funded by the Faculty of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences, and is open to all postgraduate students at Newcastle University and universities which constitute the NINE-DTP consortium. The aim is to provide a strong foundation in what is fast becoming the standard package for data analysis, manipulation and visualisation. By the end of this course, attendees will have a sufficiently strong foundation to enable them to work on more complex challenges in their own time.

## Information:

**When:** 18 June, 28 June, 18 July 2021; Synchronously 10:00-12:00, 16:00-17:00, and asynchronously  
**Session Plan:**

| Session | Time |
| --- | --- |
|Lecture and group work|10.00 -- 12.00|
|Break/Individual work|12.00 -- 16.00|
|Q&A|16.00 -- 17.00|

**Where:** Zoom (links sent separately)  
**Instructors:** Lauren Ackerman, Jalal Al-Tamimi, and Nick Riches  

Before the workshop, please make sure you have downloaded R and RStudio. [**This** brief tutorial](docs/Setting_Up.nb.html) may help.

We also recommend [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) which is an excellent package for learning R. You load it as a package in R (see the website for detailed instructions), and it creates an interactive tutorial. If you work your way through "swirl" this may give you a headstart in the R training, but it is not a necessary precursor for this workshop. Before the beginning of the workshop, if you have been using swirl, please remember to exit swirl using the bye() function (which it will teach you how to use). This will prevent errors during the taught session and individual work.

## Schedule:

The links and content therein for each day may be changed and updated between now and the day they are taught. Be sure to check back right before the session to ensure you have access to the most up-to-date versions.

### Day 1:

**Morning:** [Introduction to R and RStudio](docs/Session_1-Introduction.nb.html) (Download the [Rmarkdown file](docs/Session_1-Introduction.Rmd) for this session, and the data files: [.csv format](data/WHR_2017.csv), [SPSS format](data/WHR_2017.sav), [Excel format](data/WHR_2017.xlsx))  
**Afternoon:** Q&A Session with Nick Riches

### Day 2:

**Morning:** [Visualisation and data manipulation](docs/Session_2-tidyverse.nb.html) (Download the [.Rmd file](docs/Session_2-tidyverse.Rmd) for this session)  
**Afternoon:** Q&A Session with Lauren Ackerman

### Day 3:

**Morning:** [Techniques for analysing data](docs/Session_3-AnalysingData.nb.html) (Download [the .Rmd file](docs/Session_3-AnalysingData.rmd) and the data files [grammatical](data/grammatical.csv) and [rating](data/rating.csv) for this session)  
**Afternoon:** Q&A Session with Jalal Al-Tamimi


*We regret that due to the limited capacity of the room we may not be able to offer a place to all those who apply.*

## What to bring: 

We are unable to supply any PCs and we would ask attendees to *have personal computers or laptops with copies of R and RStudio already installed*
(please visit  [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) to download R, and [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/) to download RStudio). We believe that itâ€™s preferable to work on laptops rather than university machines as it is much easier to update R to the latest version.

If you already have R and RStudio installed, we recommend you update to the latest versions. Updating R means you need to also update any installed packages. 

### Notes:

16 June 2021: Please install the latest version of R (version 4.1.0 Camp Pontanezen), the latest version of R Studio (version 1.4.1717) and the following packages, which we will use during our workshop:  

```
tidyverse
palmerpenguins
cowplot
knitr
ordinal
broom
emmeans
Hmisc
corrplot
psycho
PresenceAbsence
lme4
