# Welcome to the Adventures In R Workshop!

*This repository will serve as the base for designing and sharing materials for the 2019 Workshop in R.*

This workshop has been funded by the Faculty of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences, and is open to all postgraduate students at Newcastle University and universities which constitute the NINE-DTP consortium. The aim is to provide a strong foundation in what is fast becoming the standard package for data analysis, manipulation and visualisation. By the end of this course, attendees will have a sufficiently strong foundation to enable them to work on more complex challenges in their own time.

Before the workshop, please make sure you have downloaded R and RStudio. [**This** brief tutorial](docs/Setting_Up.nb.html) may help.

## Schedule:

We anticipate that basic refreshments, including lunch, will be provided.

### Day 1: (To be updated)

**Morning:** [Introduction to R and RStudio](/docs/Session_1-Introduction.nb.html) (Download the [Rmarkdown file](/docs/Session_1-Introduction.Rmd) for this session)  
**Afternoon:** [Processing text and corpus data](docs/Session_3.nb.html) (Download [the .Rmd file](docs/Session_3.Rmd) and [the data file](data/Shakespeare_data.csv) for this session) 

### Day 2:

**Morning:** [Visualisation and data manipulation](docs/Session_2-plots_dplyr.html) (Download the [.Rmd file](docs/Session_2-plots_dplyr.Rmd) and [the dialect data](data/dialectdata.csv), [reaction time data](data/reactiondata.txt), and [other data](data/plantanimalrt.csv) for this session)
**Afternoon:** [Techniques for analysing data](docs/Session_4-AnalysingData.nb.html) (Download [the .Rmd file](docs/Session_4-AnalysingData.rmd) and the data files [grammatical](data/grammatical.csv) and [rating](data/rating.csv) for this session)


*We regret that due to the limited capacity of the room we may not be able to offer a place to all those who apply.*

## What to bring:

The room does not contain any PCs and we would ask attendees to *bring laptops with copies of R and RStudio already installed*
(please visit  [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) to download R, and [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/) to download RStudio). We believe that it’s preferable to work on laptops rather than university machines as it is much easier to update R to the latest version.

If you already have R and RStudio installed, we recommend you update to the latest versions. Updating R means you need to also update any installed packages. 

### Notes:

22 June 2019: please install the following packages (if not already installed) that we will use during our workshop. 

tidyverse; psycho; ordinal; PresenceAbsence; broom; emmeans; car; tidytext; knitr

12 June 2019: Please install the latest version of R (3.6.0). Also install the latest version of R Studio (version 1.2.1335). We will send a list of all packages to be installed.
