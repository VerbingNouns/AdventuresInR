# Welcome to the Adventures In R Workshop!

*This repository will serve as the base for designing and sharing materials for the 2020 Workshop in R.*

This workshop has been funded by the Faculty of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences, and is open to all postgraduate students at Newcastle University and universities which constitute the NINE-DTP consortium. The aim is to provide a strong foundation in what is fast becoming the standard package for data analysis, manipulation and visualisation. By the end of this course, attendees will have a sufficiently strong foundation to enable them to work on more complex challenges in their own time.

## Information:

**When:** 3, 5, 8 June 2020; Synchronously 10:00-12:00, 16:00-17:00, and asynchronously  
**Session Plan:**

| Session | Time |
| --- | --- |
|Lecture and group work|10.00 -- 12.00|
|Break/Individual work|12.00 -- 16.00|
|Q&A|16.00 -- 17.00|

**Where:** Zoom (link sent separately)  
**Instructors:** Lauren Ackerman, Jalal Al-Tamimi, and Nick Riches  

Before the workshop, please make sure you have downloaded R and RStudio. [**This** brief tutorial](docs/Setting_Up.nb.html) may help.

We also recommend [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) which is an excellent package for learning R. You load it as a package in R (see the website for detailed instructions), and it creates an interactive tutorial. If you work your way through "swirl" this may give you a headstart in the R training, but it is not a necessary precursor for this workshop.

## Schedule:


### Day 1:

**Morning:** [Introduction to R and RStudio]() (Download the [Rmarkdown file]() for this session)  
**Afternoon:** Q&A Session with Nick Riches

### Day 2:

**Morning:** [Visualisation and data manipulation]() (Download the [.Rmd file]() and [dataset]() for this session)  
**Afternoon:** Q&A Session with Lauren Ackerman

### Day 3:

**Morning:** [Techniques for analysing data]() (Download [the .Rmd file]() and the data files [grammatical](data/grammatical.csv) and [rating](data/rating.csv) for this session)  
**Afternoon:** Q&A Session with Jalal Al-Tamimi


*We regret that due to the limited capacity of the room we may not be able to offer a place to all those who apply.*

## What to bring: 

We are unable to supply any PCs and we would ask attendees to *have personal computers or laptops with copies of R and RStudio already installed*
(please visit  [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) to download R, and [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/) to download RStudio). We believe that itâ€™s preferable to work on laptops rather than university machines as it is much easier to update R to the latest version.

If you already have R and RStudio installed, we recommend you update to the latest versions. Updating R means you need to also update any installed packages.
