This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
1+3
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.  

You can *Knit* your document to pdf and Word too.

# This afternoon's Session
Today, we're going to be analysing data from a dialect survey dataset discussed in class.  The questions asked as part of this dialect survey should be available in the **docs** folder of your downloaded folder.

## Packages
The first thing we want to do before we start is load in the relevant packages for today.  The following code should do the job:
```{r}
## LOAD PACKAGES ####
library(dplyr) # this is a package that makes handling data easier
library(ggplot2) # this is a package that makes nice graphs
```
You might see some messages, but that is fine.

However, if this doesn't work, you may need to install the packages.  You only have to install a package once, but you have load a package in (like we just did above) every time you open R.  To install a package for the first time, you can go to ** tools > install packages... >** and then search for the name of the package.  You can also run it directly through the console by inputting `install.packages("dplyr")`.


## Dialect data
The data itself is in the **data** folder, which is a folder within the current R Markdown folder. That means we can easily load it in without having to specify the full path (i.e. location) of the document.  Try pressing play on the chunk below to read in the data:

```{r}
## LOAD IN DATA ####
dialect_data = read.csv("dialectdata.csv")
```
We have called our dataset `dialect_data` and we should now be able to see it in the right corner panel under **Environment** as one of the things we have loaded in.


Let's look at our data to get a feel for what is in there:
```{r}
dim(dialect_data)
```
How many rows and columns does the data have?

Let's have a look at the top six rows:
```{r}
head(dialect_data)
```
 
How about the bottom six?
```{r}
tail(dialect_data)
```

What are the names of the columns?
```{r}
colnames(dialect_data)
```
Note that the column names all have lower case titles.  R does not treat uppercase and lower case the same!  This is the advice given by Hadley Wickham in his R style guide: (http://stat405.had.co.nz/r-style.html).Instead of a space, use and underscore.  R will not allow spaces in column names.


Let's use the `levels()` function from to take a closer look at some of the columns.
```{r}
# Look at factor levels for some columns
levels(dialect_data$foot_strut)
levels(dialect_data$give_it_me)
```

As discussed, the dollar sign is very important in R, as it references a specific column.  For the two columns we've referenced in the above example, R shows us the range of possible variants or **factor levels**.  For the factor `foot_strut` the possible answers, are therefore factor levels, are `rhyme` and `don't rhyme`.  For the factor `give_it_me`, there are five possible answers, as shown by the five factor levels.


### Data summaries: Making tables

Let's say we want to see how many of our respondents have said that "foot" and "strut" rhyme, and how many say they don't.  We can do this easily using the table function in R.  Note that we use the dollar sign $ again to denote the specific `foot_strut` column within the `dialect_data` dataset.

```{r}
table(dialect_data$foot_strut)
```

This would be our dependent variable, but can we think of a possible independent variable we'd want to look at too?  We can add this in simply by adding another instruction to the table.  Let's try this with speaker age group (categorical):

```{r}
table(dialect_data$foot_strut, dialect_data$age_group)
```
Note, we also have the specific speaker age (continuous), but that's going to be difficult to visualise in a table, so we'll leave that for now.

Try this below for a different independent variable of your choice:

```{r}
#your code here for your choice of independent variable
```

These numbers are not ideal in terms of presenting a result to our audience.We really want to be showing them the percentage of speakers who say rhyme and don't rhyme, rather than the raw numbers.  How can we do this?

There are always numerous ways to do things in R.  Sometimes, I'll use the functions that come installed with basic R, other times I'll be showing you additional packages that we can install that will make our lives easier.

### Basic proportional tables for categorical data

The first step to making a proportional table would be saving our current table as a variable in R.  

```{r}
foot_strut.tab = table(dialect_data$foot_strut, dialect_data$age_group)
```

Once you run this code, you should be able to see your new `foot_strut.tab` in the right hand corner *environment* window.  I like to call it R's brain.  You have now saved `foot_strut.tab` in R's brain and you can call it up whenever you want during the session. Let's try it now by running the code below:

```{r}
foot_strut.tab 
```
Note that I have given it a `.tab` at the end of its name.  Once you get going, you'll have potentially hundreds of things stored in R's brain.  So by giving them names with `.tab` on the end for tables or `.plot` on the end for plots, you'll make life a bit easier for yourself in the long run.

OK, so how do we make a percentage table, or a proportional table?  We can do this with the `prop.table` function:
```{r}
prop.table(foot_strut.tab, 2) 
```
This gives us the breakdown in percentages.  Is the `foot_strut` variable changing over time between old, middle and young people's speech?

Let's save this in R's brain:
```{r}
foot_strut.prop.tab = prop.table(foot_strut.tab, 2) 
```

What does the `,2` bit mean at the end of the call though?  This tells R to divide the proportions using the *second* variable of the table call, not the first.  That is, we want to divide each value by the total of the *young, middle and old* columns, and not by the *don't rhyme/rhyme rows*.  We always want to divide by the independent variable.  Why is this?

Take a look at what happens when you try to divide by the first variable of the table call:
```{r}
# WRONG WAY AROUND
prop.table(foot_strut.tab, 1) 
```
What is wrong with this?  

This is a very important thing to remember.  We want the independent variable column to be the one that adds up to 100%, to ensure that in cases like these where we have many more participants in one category (young) than another (old) our proportions work our correctly.  

Note that, if our original table call had put `age_group` before `foot_strut`, the number would actually be `1`.  It's whatever position the independent variable is in.

Ideally, the table you'll present to your reader will have percentages in, but also a row below with the totals for each column.

### Making summary tables with `dplyr`

`dplyr` is an R package which makes it very easy to look at summaries of data.  Even though some people consider it more advanced, I think it's a good idea to introduce beginners to it from the start.  We're going to try to do the same using this package.  

We already loaded it in at the start, but if you hadn't have done that by now, the following code would not work.  Always make sure you've run the line `library(dplyr)` at the beginning of each session to run this kind of code.

`dplyr` makes regular use of this set of symbols, which it calls the *pipe*: `%>%`. This signifies to R that you haven't finished with your code yet, and it needs to look to the next line to figure out what's happening next. It's *piping* the code to the next line. If you get an error message about the pipe `%>%`, it probably means you haven't loaded in `dplyr`.

```{r}
dialect_data %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>% # the independent variable
  count(foot_strut) %>% # the dependent variable
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n))
```
Can you see how this package allows us to do the same thing as we did before, but a bit quicker?  

Create a chunk below and try creating some other summaries in `dplyr`.  First, let's create a summary for another independent variable of `foot_strut`:
```{r}
# here you can look at another independent variable's affect on foot_strut

```

Now let's try a different independent *and* dependent variable.  Insert a new chunk below by clicking on *Insert > R *:





We've seen in this section that there's always (at least!) a couple of ways to do things in R.  In the next section we'll look at making some plots, starting off with the R base graphics, and moving on to some more advanced packages which look more difficult at the beginning, but actually make life easier in the end, and produce much nicer looking plots.

## Plots

### Base R graphics
Let's try making a plot of the `foot_strut` variable.  We can use Base R's `barplot` function to do this, and it's useful that we've already made tables of the frequencies and proportions.  

We could just plot the raw frequencies, but this isn't very helpful:
```{r}
barplot(foot_strut.tab)
```
This graph looks quite rubbish.  It's unclear what the trend is, as our sample is so biased towards young people.  Also, it's annoying for us that R automatically plots factor levels in alphabetical order, because it puts the middle aged group at the front.  We'll come to that in a bit.  

Firstly, can you try plotting the proportions instead of the frequencies?  Try it in the chunk below, and shout me if you get stuck.
```{r}
#create a barplot with the proportions of foot_strut instead of raw numbers

```


Can we get it so that it goes in order of age group?  Let's take a look at the factor levels of `age_group` using the levels function:
```{r}
levels(dialect_data$age_group)
```

Can you see that they are in alphabetical order?  We can change the order of these levels.  Again, there are many ways to do this.  We'll be looking at how you do it in 1) base R and 2) `dplyr`.  Firstly, we'll look at how you do it in base R.  In the chunk below, I've actually created a new variable called `age_group_ordered`.  You don't have to do this usually, you can just re-specify the order of `age_group`.  However, I want to keep the old order to show you how to reorder in `dplyr` too.  Saying that, sometimes, if you're not sure of what you're doing, it's better to avoid writing over the old.

Let's reorder the factor levels:
```{r}
# reordering
dialect_data$age_group_ordered = factor(dialect_data$age_group,levels(dialect_data$age_group)[c(3, 1, 2)])

#having a look at new order
levels(dialect_data$age_group_ordered)
```

Try the plot again with the new order by creating a chunk below:






### Plots in `ggplot2`

Not only do `ggplot2` plots look prettier and are easier to customise, we can also combine them with `dplyr` code to make data changes efficiently.  Both packages are written by Hadley Wickham, whose R [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) we discussed earlier in this course.

The package to make ggplots is called `ggplot2`.  Remember the `2` when you load in the package, otherwise it won't work.  We already loaded it in before, but you'll need to do that each time you start R by calling `library(ggplot2)`.

The plot call initially looks a lot more complicated. But `gg` stands for *grammar of graphics*, and as you get used to using it, you'll realise it's much easier to switch between different kinds of graphs, and customise the look of them.

Let's try a barplot for foot_strut and age_group in `ggplot2`:
```{r}
ggplot(dialect_data, aes(age_group_ordered, fill = foot_strut)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

This has given us the frequencies.  Again, it'd be better to see the percentages, rather than the raw numbers.  We can do this easily by adding `position="fill"` to the `geom_bar()` bit:

```{r}
ggplot(dialect_data, aes(age_group_ordered, fill = foot_strut)) +
  geom_bar(position="fill")
```

The beauty of ggplot is that you can just stack up command after command using the `+` symbol to customise your plot.

I can change the x axis title:
```{r}
ggplot(dialect_data, aes(age_group_ordered, fill = foot_strut)) +
  geom_bar(position="fill") +
  xlab("age group")
```

I can move the legend to the bottom:
```{r}
ggplot(dialect_data, aes(age_group_ordered, fill = foot_strut)) +
  geom_bar(position="fill") +
  xlab("age group") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

I can change the colours:
```{r}
ggplot(dialect_data, aes(age_group_ordered, fill = foot_strut)) +
  geom_bar(position="fill") +
  xlab("age group") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "yellow"))
```

Try changing the colours yourself in the chunk below:
```{r}
#my ggplot with new colours

```

In fact, if you're bad at choosing which colours go together, there are many in built colour palettes that you can use.  A list can be found [here](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf) alongside the colour names that R accepts.

Let's try a palette.  I'm going to try Set1 from the above link.  Try messing around with it to get a colour scheme you like.
```{r}
ggplot(dialect_data, aes(age_group_ordered, fill = foot_strut)) +
  geom_bar(position="fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1") 
```

Try creating a plot from scratch using a different dependent variable.  Our phonological variables are pretty orderly- they only have two factor levels, or variants.  How do things start to look with some of our syntactic variables, or lexical?  Try to make three plots: one new phonological, one new syntactic and one new lexical.

Once you've done that, you could look at other things that you can play around with in the settings of `ggplot2`.  Here you can find the [ggplot cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf).

# Continuous data
So far, we've worked with categorical data.  But lots of us will be working with continuous data, where the dependent variable is a number, rather than a category. 

The following (made up) dataset contains reaction time data from a word recognition task taken from [Page Piccinni's excellent online R course](https://pagepiccinini.com/r-course/) which comes highly recommended when you're a little more advanced.  Bilingual and monolingual speakers were given a task where they have to decide if a word is part of their language or not.  The reaction time measures how long it took them to decide.


## Reaction time data
The data itself needs to be in the same folder R Notebook document. That means we can easily load it in without having to specify the full path (i.e. location) of the document.  Try pressing play on the chunk below to read in the data:

```{r}
## LOAD IN DATA ####
rt_data = read.delim("reactiondata.txt")
```

Do you notice anything different here?  This dataset is a `.txt` file, not a `.csv` file.  Do you know the difference between these types of file?  It doesn't matter which one yours is, but you need to make sure the call is `read.delim()` for `.txt` files and `read.csv()` for `.csv` files

We have called our dataset `rt_data` (which stands for *reaction time* data) and we should now be able to see it in the right corner panel under **Environment** as one of the things we have loaded in.

This data is kindly donated by Page Piccinni, who has a fantastic (if a little advanced) R course online here: (https://pagepiccinini.com/r-course/)

Let's look at our data to get a feel for what is in there:
```{r}
dim(rt_data)
```
How many rows and columns does the data have?

Let's have a look at the top six rows:
```{r}
head(rt_data)
```
Is there some missing data here?  Or should we expect to find this?


How about the bottom six?
```{r}
tail(rt_data)
```

What are the names of the columns?
```{r}
colnames(rt_data)
```

Which is our dependent variable, out of these three?

## Looking more closely at data

Let's use the `levels()` function from last week to take a closer look at some of the columns.
```{r}
# Look at factor levels for some columns
levels(rt_data$group)
levels(rt_data$type)
```

So it looks like the `group` factor has two levels and so does the `type` factor.  Consider what these two factors represent in the dataset.  Why did it look like there was missing data when we read in the `head` command before?

We can also see how many tokens there are of each by looking at a table of what's going on.  Let's have a look at `group`:
```{r}
table(rt_data$group)
```

And type:
```{r}
table(rt_data$type)
```

Why are the numbers not the same?  What is `type`?



Anyway, our dependent variable here is `rt` or *reaction time*.  Can we look at the factor levels of that?

```{r}
levels(rt_data$rt)
```

What does this mean?  Why is it saying this?


Let's try something else:
```{r}
summary(rt_data$rt)
```

OK, so it looks like we have reaction time data, which is our continuous dependent variable, and we can look at this across two potential independent variables.  `group` tells us if someone is bilingual or monolingual, and `type` gives us extra details about the bilinguals, on their profiency in their second language.


## Plots of continuous data
We've already learnt how to make barplots.  However, these are for when we have a categorical dependent variable.  When we have a continuous dependent variable, and categorical independent variables, the best option is usually a boxplot.

We can make boxplots very quickly and easily in Base R.  We have the dependent variable first, then the `~` tilde symbol, then the independent variable we're interested in.  Try running this for the reaction time across the `type` variable:
```{r}
boxplot(rt_data$rt ~ rt_data$type)
```
What does this graph show us?

Try it yourself for the group variable in the chunk below

```{r}
# plot and run the group variable in this chunk


```
What does the graph show you?  What differences or similarities do you spot in the two plots?


We also might want to view the general distribution of the reaction times, which we can do with a histogram:
```{r}
hist(rt_data$rt)
```
I wouldn't always use histograms in my report, but they are very useful for showing you the distribution of the data.  For example, I can immediately see here that the data is not normally distributed but, in fact, seems to have a bimodal distribution. 

##  ggplots
The syntax of ggplots is slightly more complicated, but it is more customisable, and looks much nicer.  Let's try a boxplot in `ggplot2` using the `geom_boxplot()` call:

```{r}
ggplot(rt_data, aes(x = group, y = rt)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Try making it more colourful by setting the factor levels of `group` to `colour`
```{r}
ggplot(rt_data, aes(x = group, y = rt, colour = group)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Or you can use `fill` to fill them in:
```{r}
ggplot(rt_data, aes(x = group, y = rt, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Remember our [colour palettes](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf) from last week?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(rt_data, aes(x=group, y=rt, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot() +
   scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral")
```
Note, if we're setting the `fill` it needs to be `scale_fill_brewer` and if we're setting the `colour` it needs to be `scale_colour_brewer`.

There is no way to save plots separately from an R Notebook (although we'll look at an automatic way in a bit).  Instead, drag up the console from the bottom of the screen and run your code in there.  Your plot should now show in the bottom right panel, and there is an option to export here.

Try it yourself. Create your own plot of the `group` variable with different colours:
```{r}

```

Now try making a ggplot of the `type` variable:
```{r}

```
What do you notice about this graph?  Are there any potential problems with it?  Do we need to do anything with the data?



What are **NAs**?  NA stands for *not applicable* and means that there is data missing for that cell.  In this case, it is part of the experimental design.  in other cases, it might be an accident, and you may have to go back and check you don't have missing data.


## Subsetting
As you may have realised above, we only have `type` data for the bilinguals, which makes sense given this experiment.  Therefore, it doesn't really make sense to look at the monolinguals when we are considering if someone is high or low profiency.  This is where creating **subsets** comes in useful in R.  We can create a subset for just the bilinguals.

As usual, there are always a few ways to do things in R.  We'll start with the basic way, and move on to the more advanced way using `dplyr` later.

### Basic subsetting

Here's how we can create a bilingual subset in base R:
```{r}
bl_data = subset(rt_data, group =="bilingual")
```

Here we come across the double equals sign.  So far, we've been using `=` a single equals sign to assign things to variables.  Remember I also said people often use `<=` instead of `=` and it does the same thing.  The double equals sign `==` means *must equal*, so R will only return those factor levels which have *bilingual* in them.

Let's use the usual functions to have a look at this new subsetted dataset:

```{r}
dim(bl_data)
head(bl_data)
tail(bl_data)
```


Now we can try to make a plot of `type` without the monolinguals, by using our new subset:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(bl_data, aes(x=type, y=rt, fill=type)) + geom_boxplot() 
```
What can we conclude from this graph?

Once you've done that, you could look at other things that you can play around with in the settings of `ggplot2`.  Here you can find the [ggplot cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf).

Here's my final graph that I think looks nice:
```{r}
ggplot(bl_data, aes(x=type, y=rt, colour=type)) + geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("reaction time (ms)") +
  xlab("") +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  theme_bw()
```


### Subsetting in `dplyr`

We can also subset in `dplyr`.  Not only can we do this in a similar way to above, by creating a new dataset, we can also *pipe* straight into a ggplot.  Let's look at both ways.

The code below creates another subset of the bilingual data.  This should be exactly the same as our old one.  I've just given it a different name:

```{r}
bl_data_dplyr = rt_data %>%
  filter(group == "bilingual")
```
Again, we see the use of the double equals.  We also see the `dplyr` verb `filter`.  For a list of all possible `dplyr` verbs, see the following cheatsheet: (https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)


Let's use the usual functions to have a look at this:
```{r}
dim(bl_data_dplyr)
head(bl_data_dplyr)
tail(bl_data_dplyr)
```

It looks exactly the same, so we won't make any new plots.  

** ADVANCED**   You can use whichever of these two ways you prefer, but one benefit of the second way is that you can actually use similar syntax to pipe the subset directly into a ggplot.  That way, you don't even have to create a new subset.

```{r}
rt_data %>%
  filter(group == "bilingual") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=type, y=rt, colour=type)) + geom_boxplot() 
```
This just pipes `rt_data` through, filters out anything that's not *bilingual*, and then plots it.  So you can see, there's no dataset in the usual place in the ggplot call, because that comes earlier.

### More subsetting

We can also put different conditions on subsets.  The `!=` operator means not equals to.  So this would give us the same thing as before:

```{r}
bl_data_dplyr = rt_data %>%
  filter(group != "monolingual")
```

Maybe we just want to look at people who responded in under a second.  We could create a dataset that can account for this using the `<` sign (you can also use `>` than).

```{r}
quick_rt_data = rt_data %>%
  filter(rt < 1000)
```

Or plot this directly:
```{r}
rt_data %>%
  filter(rt < 1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=group, y=rt, colour=group)) + geom_boxplot() 
```

If you've finished all of this, try making some extra graphs of your own and changing the parameters using the cheatsheets above.  Then try outputting this document to pdf, word or html.

### Density plots
We saw a histogram above in R base graphics.  Let's have a look at a few in ggplot.

```{r}
ggplot(rt_data, aes(rt)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=20) #binwidth tells us what numbers we should bin by.  Try changing it if you want
```

```{r}
ggplot(rt_data, aes(rt)) +
    geom_density() 
```
It seems we have a bimodal distribution.  What could this be by?  Let's fill by `group`.

```{r}
ggplot(rt_data, aes(rt, fill=group)) +
    geom_density() 
```
A very clear pattern.  Let's try our `bl_data` subset and fill by type.

```{r}
ggplot(bl_data, aes(rt, fill=type)) +
    geom_density() 
```
Try playing around with the colours and axes etc.


### Saving plots to file

Above, I explained how to manually save a plot by running the relevant code in the R console window, hidden below this R Markdown window.

Another way is to save a plot into the R environment, and then save it to folder from there.  Here's an example.  First I give my plot a name, so it's saved into R's brain.  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
bl.plot =
  ggplot(bl_data, aes(x=type, y=rt, colour=type)) + geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("reaction time (ms)") +
  xlab("") +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_bw()
```

I've called it `bl.plot`.  So that means if I type that into R, it should show me my plot:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
bl.plot
```
Note that it didn't show me the plot in the previous chunk - it just saved it.  I have to type the name in again for it to show me what it looks like.

Now, I'm going to go into the main folder for this course and create a new folder called `figures`.  We are going to save your plots into that folder, so we are nice and organised.

```{r, eval =FALSE}
pdf("figures/bilingualplot.pdf")# this tells R where to store the plot
bl.plot # which plot we want to store
dev.off() # this finishes the plotting device
```
Go back and try saving some of your previous figures to folder in this way.



## Plant animal reaction time data: cleaning and `geom_point`

We will now use a third dataset to look at examples on how to nicely clean up data, and also to make a graph.  We have yet another reaction time toy dataset `plantanimalrt.csv`.  Let's load it in:

```{r}
## LOAD IN DATA ####
plantanimal_data = read.csv("plantanimalrt.csv")
```

Subjects have been shown words and have to decide if it is a plant or animal.  Their reaction time is recorded as well as if they got the answer right.
```{r}
## look at data
head(plantanimal_data)
dim(plantanimal_data)
```

There are a few things I'd like to change about this data.  I'm going to do this by creating a new dataset `plantanimal_clean` based on the old one, and use `dplyr` commands to change things.

I will use the `dplyr` verb `mutate` to:

* change `rt` into seconds (currently in deci-seconds)
* change `F` and `M` in the `sex` column to female and male

```{r}
## CLEAN DATA ####
plantanimal_clean = plantanimal_data %>%
  mutate(rt = rt/10, 
         sex = recode(sex, "F" = "female", "M" = "male"))
```
When you get more advanced with R, see here for the `dplyr` cheatsheet:(https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

Let's try making a plot to see if reaction times are quicker for more frequent words:
```{r}
ggplot(plantanimal_clean, aes(frequency, rt)) + geom_point()
```
Is there a trend?  It's difficult to tell, but we can add a smoothing line to help us:

```{r}
ggplot(plantanimal_clean, aes(frequency, rt)) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth()
```

Is there any difference between animals and plants?
```{r}
ggplot(plantanimal_clean, aes(frequency, rt, colour=class)) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth()
```

Try a density plot of reaction time, like we did before.


# R markdown
You can convert this entire notebook into a pdf, html or Word document by going to the little triangle drop-down menu next to **Preview** and choosing one of the **Knit to...** options.  This is how I'd like you to submit your assessment for class, but it is also handy for writing up your quantitative work, as your R code is embedded in your document.

As you start to publish your work, you won't want the R code itself to show, but just the output.  This is easy to do by setting the option `echo = FALSE`.  Try previewing the document, or knitting the document to pdf, html or word, and compare the chunk below with earlier ones:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
1+3
```
Can you see this stops it from replicating the code?

Markdown is a very simple language.  You use *stars for italics*, and you use **double stars for bold**.  Hashes indicate new sections and the level of that section (i.e. two hashes are a subsection).  Check out the R markdown cheatsheet [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).  You can see I just made a clickable link in the previous sentence.  Have a look at what that looks like in your knitted output.  For your next task, have a play around with different options in R markdown.
